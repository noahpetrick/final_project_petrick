For this project, I did a whole bunch of cool stuff.

Initially, I couldn't figure out how to use Modals in order to make a more user-friendly graphical interface.
And even when I did, I wasn't confident enough to use them consistently. However, when I finally started to get good
at using modals, I used the heck out of them.
You'll see that most of my pages use models to display all types of information and forms. They are super helpful, and
they make for a cleaner/more organized look.

In terms of API, I would say that my user login and admin login features are the most notable. It took a lot of trial and error with
my database structure, my functions, and my blueprints in order to get the authentication features to work. But boy was it satisfying
when I finally got it. The leader board on the home page was also a really cool feature that I added. I used a few different libraries
to get that up and running.

Also, my image file features are also pretty notable.
I expected to have a lot of trouble with trying to implement a feature that allows users to upload files for profile images, as well as
SLAG submissions. But it was easier than anticipated. This app allows users to submit and view images with ease. I'm pretty proud of that.

Although this is my final project, I fully plan on continuing my work with this app. I want to first add some more features that
I think are necessary for a fully functional app. And eventually, I want to convert this application into a mobile app for my
fraternity.

Anyways, please give me feedback on my project. Any tips or sugestions would be much appreciated. I'm looking for anyway that I can
improve the work I've got.

Thanks for a great semester, Dr. Marshall!
